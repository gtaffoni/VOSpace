# VOSpace

## What is it?

VOSpace

VOSpace is the  [IVOA](http://www.ivoa.net/)interface to distributed storage.
It specifies how VO agents and applications can use network attached data
stores to persist and exchange data in a standard way.

A VOSpace web service is an access point for a distributed storage network.
Through this access point, a client can:

1. add or delete data objects in a tree data structure;

2. manipulate metadata for the data objects

3. obtain URIs through which the content of the data objects can be accessed

VOSpace does not define how the data is stored or transferred, only the
control messages to gain access.
Thus, the VOSpace interface can readily be added to an existing storage system.

When we speak of "a VOSpace", we mean the arrangement of data accessible
through one particular VOSpace service.

Each data object within a VOSpace service is represented as a node and has
a description called a representation.
A useful analogy to have in mind when reading this document
is that a node is equivalent to a file or a directory.
